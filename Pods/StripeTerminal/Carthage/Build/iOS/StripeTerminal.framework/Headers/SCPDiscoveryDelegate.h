/**
 Implement this protocol to handle a continually updating list
 of discovered readers. You must pass an `SCPDiscoveryDelegate`
 when calling `-[SCPTerminal discoverReaders:delegate:completion:]`.

 @see https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/readers/connecting
 */
NS_SWIFT_NAME(DiscoveryDelegate)
@protocol SCPDiscoveryDelegate <NSObject>

/**
 This method will be called repeatedly until:
 - an error occurs
 - `-[SCPTerminal discoverReaders:delegate:completion:]` is canceled via the
 `SCPCancelable` that it returned.
 - `-[SCPTerminal connectReader:completion:]` is called with a discovered reader

 You should *not* cache the `SCPReader` objects in the readers array. In other
 words, after calling `connectReader:` with a discovered reader, you should not
 attempt to cache and re-use the `Reader` object. The connectivity information
 associated with the discovered `Reader` object will become stale.

 Bluetooth Scan
 --------------

 When discovering a reader using this method, this `didUpdateDiscoveredReaders`
 delegate method will be called multiple times as the Bluetooth scan
 proceeds.

 Your app should display an updating list of discovered readers if
 your user is connecting to a reader for the first time.

 Otherwise, you may automatically select a previously saved reader.
 Once a selection has been made, call the `connectReader` method to begin
 connecting to the reader.

 Bluetooth Proximity
 -------------------

 When discovering a reader using this method, this `didUpdateDiscoveredReaders`
 delegate method will be called twice. It will be called for the first time
 when the reader is initially discovered. The reader's LEDs will begin
 flashing. After a short delay, `didUpdateDiscoveredReaders` will be called
 a second time with an updated reader object, populated with additional
 info about the device, like its battery level.

 @param terminal        The originating SCPTerminal.
 @param readers         The discovered readers.
