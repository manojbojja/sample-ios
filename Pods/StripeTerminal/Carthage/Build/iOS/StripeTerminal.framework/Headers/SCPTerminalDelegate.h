 The reader disconnected unexpectedly (that is, without your app explicitly
 calling `disconnectReader`).

 In your implementation of this method, you should notify your user that
 the reader disconnected. You may also want to call `discoverReaders` to begin
 scanning for readers. Your app can attempt to automatically reconnect to the
 disconnected reader, or display UI for your user to re-connect to a reader.

 You can trigger this call in your app by powering off the connected reader.
